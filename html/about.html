  <h1 class="about-h1">Welcome</h1>
  <p class="about-p">
      My name is Ryan Fuhrman and I am a web developer. I'm currently located in Tallahassee, Florida.
    </p>
    <p class="about-p">
      With a focus on front-end development, I utilize JavaScript to bring ideas to life. I enjoy simple, to the point, design that puts the product first and I bring this same approach to my code. 
    </p>
    <p class="about-p">
      I love tech, but I also love trying new foods and craft beers. I'm a proud FSU alumn and unashamed Cincinnati Bengals fan.
